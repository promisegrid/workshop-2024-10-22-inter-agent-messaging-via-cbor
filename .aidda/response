# Inter-agent Messaging via CBOR

---

## What Exactly is Inter-agent Messaging and Why is it Hard?

- Inter-agent messaging refers to the communication between autonomous agents in a distributed system.
- Challenges include ensuring reliable message exchanges and maintaining a shared understanding without central control.
- Agents need to operate in heterogeneous environments where scalability is a critical factor.

---

## Problems in Decentralized Inter-agent Messaging

### Need to Avoid Central Registries

- Central registries can become single points of failure and scalability bottlenecks.
- Decentralized systems require mechanisms to function independently of central authorities.

### Message Format Tower of Babel

- Different agents might use incompatible message formats, leading to communication breakdowns.
- Standardizing message formats is crucial but hard to achieve in a decentralized context.

### Self-describing Messages

- Important for agents to interpret messages without prior knowledge of the format.
- Ensures interoperability by embedding schema information within messages themselves.

### Parsing Speed with XML or JSON

- Traditional formats like XML or JSON can be verbose and slow to parse.
- Reducing parsing overhead is necessary for performance in real-time systems.

## What is CBOR and How Does it Solve These Problems?

### Binary

- CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) is a binary format that reduces message size and parsing time.
- Improves efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

### Prefixes

- CBOR messages include prefixes that indicate data types, aiding in quick parsing.

### Standardized, RFC'd

- CBOR is an established standard with RFC (Request for Comments) documentation, ensuring broad adoption and support.

### Existing Libraries (Including Go)

- Multiple languages, including Go, have CBOR libraries, facilitating integration across different platforms.
- These libraries simplify encoding and decoding tasks, leveraging the benefits of CBOR out-of-the-box.

## Usage Examples

### In Promisegrid's Grid-cli or Grid-poc

- CBOR is used to transfer messages in Promisegrid's implementations, demonstrating practical, real-world applications.
- These examples highlight CBOR's capability in distributed computing scenarios, showing its impact on reducing complexity and enhancing communication between agents.
